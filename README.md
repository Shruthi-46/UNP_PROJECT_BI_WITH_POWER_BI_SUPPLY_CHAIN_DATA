# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA

Completed this project as part of my Value added course Mastering BI with PowerBi with United Network of Professionals (UNP)
In this project, I have utilized Microsoft Power BI to design and develop an interactive supply chain dashboard, focusing on comprehensive analysis and actionable insights.
Each dashboard was complemented by a detailed summary, highlighting key insights and recommendations for strategic decision-making. This project demonstrates data visualization, analytical thinking, and deriving value-driven solutions for supply chain management.
